-   Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

### Component Guidelines

-   Use functional components with hooks

-   Use PascalCase for component names
-   Export components as default exports

### File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ globals.css         # Global styles
â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx          # Root layout
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx           # Home page
â””â”€â”€ [other-pages]/     # Additional pages
